# Task 4: Regular Show Knowledge Base with SWI-Prolog

For this task I used SWI prolog to load a knowledge base about regular show. I thoguht this would be fun because when I think about 'relationship' in terms of KB its easy to think about it this way. I loaded the KB into a .pl file then uploaded it to the main script. 

To run this script, make sure you start a virtual enviroment and get the dependencies up. (i have a startup script for this since SWI-prolog is arm64 native and im on mac so I needed a venv to get it up and going)
