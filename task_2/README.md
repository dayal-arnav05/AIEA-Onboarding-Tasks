Hi! Just a simple README idk if you guys are really checking in depth if the code works but heres how to set it up otherwise.

Just push your OPENAI_API_KEY into an .env file or just use the command I think its like 'export OPEN_AI_API_KEY='xyz'


I like to create a virtual enviroment but do as you please just a pip install -r requirements.txt should be good. And then just run the api.py file like normal! Pretty simple it just generates a response from the api client then parses it through pyswip to vaidate easy peasy. 

Also as of pushing this I don't have access to the namespace. I asked on discord but am waiting on follow up so the code at this very moment might need a little more configuring. I don't think it really matters since I'll just have to change the key but if there is some issue on your end when running through the namespace key let me know I'll debug. Thanks!
